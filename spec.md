either endless scroll (need to unload content before, how will it handle scrolling back?)  
shorts like scroll, you get a banner, and then you can click like space and or a button to go to the next one  
website should go to /seed first so it can remember it incase the user wants the pattern as well
header can use /banner and /metadata to boast about the amount of combinations (and colors & such).  
then make some basic "how to craft" ui (minecraft styled? via the loom & item textures etc).  

domain: **allminecraftbanners.com** (via cloudflare)  

eventually tidy up backend & stuff & just make it open source  
move mcb into its own crate in this workspace (just banner & pattern adding, including base static bytes)  
also some stats on the server would be amazing (like how many banners generated & stuff)
